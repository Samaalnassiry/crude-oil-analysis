This project is a demo of machine learning forecasting done on a dataset of crude oil production by country from 2001-2021. This project will be continuesly updated with more diverse models. The data is sourced from OECD:
https://data.oecd.org/energy/crude-oil-production.htm

The idea of this project is to be able to view various stats about a country's production from one dataset that holds information for over 94 appropriate countries. This avoids the need to create multiple datasets for each country thus maxamizing productivity and space. The raw data was cleaned and process through SQL and then visualized through Tablaeu, which features the density of production by each year. This is featured in an adjacent project, 'OECD-oil-prod-data-cleaning' .
